# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Extensions Used:

ES7 React/Redux snippets

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm init create-react-app react-task-tracker`

Run this in the terminal.

### `npm i react-icons`

Download the React icons in the current local working directory.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

## For Development

src folder

## For Production

build folder

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm i -g serve`

Install serve globally (terminal changed to command prompt)

### `serve -s build -p 8000`

Server hosting on port 8000 (Production build)

### `npm i json-server`

Install json server locally on current working directory
In package.json, under "scripts", type out a new key as "server" and its corresponding value as "json-server --watch db.json --port 5000"

db.json contains the data being stored in the server

### `npm run server`

Run server in terminal, server is being hosted on port 5000.

### `npm i react-router-dom`

Download react-router-dom locally for routing options

## Other Scripts

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
